Builds of Speedipillar that you can download and play

10/12/2023 - First build, completed in time for my anniversary with my girlfriend. Note, this build is not currently optimized in any way and is more a demonstration/proof of concept of what the game will ultimately look be. Text is currently not sized correctly for most screens and the follower body parts of the character do not follow at the correct speed. Fixes coming soon.

10/27/2023 - Second playable build, a much cleaner build. Fixed the bug with text sizing and updated the game's movement to improve collision detection. Followers should also follow at proper speed but will test on the actual build tomorrow.
